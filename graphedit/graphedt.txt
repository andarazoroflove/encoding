DETAILED
========

Revised GraphEdit application

The GraphEdit utility benefits from several improvements, particularly 
with respect to its user interface, menus, and toolbar.  Additionally,

- Graph resizing code (View->xxx %) handles all sizes correctly, and 
  you can resize your graphs using the menu, keyboard +/- keys, and 
  Ctrl+MouseWheel.  

- You can optionally disable the seek bar (and its timed updates), which 
  has been known to cause difficulty when debugging filters with GraphEdit.  

- To preserve screen real estate, source and file writer filters displayed 
  in GraphEdit will now only display their corresponding filenames as the 
  filter name, instead of displaying the fully qualified path name.  
  For example, a file source for the file 
  "C:\DXSDK\samples\Multimedia\Media\lake.mpg" would display "lake.mpg".
