<center><h2>Xsharpen Filter for VirtualDub<br><small>(Version 1.0)</small></h2></center>
<small>[Place this HTML file and the accompanying JPEG images
in the VirtualDub plugins directory to
make them available via the Help button on the filter configuration
dialog box. The computer must have an HTML browser, such as Internet
Explorer or Netscape, available in its search path.]</small>
<p>
This filter performs a subtle but useful sharpening effect. It operates by running
a small window over the frame and each center pixel is either passed
through untouched (depending upon a threshold setting), or mapped to either the
brightest or dimmest pixel in the window, depending upon which is nearest to the center pixel.
If the center pixel is mapped, it is also alpha-blended with the original pixel value
using a configurable strength setting. The result is a sharpening effect that not
only avoids amplifying noise, but also tends to reduce it. A welcome side effect is
that files processed with this filter tend to compress to smaller files.
<p>
Following are before and after pictures from a satellite image (default parameters):

And here are before and after pictures from a color image (default parameters):
<p>
<img src="flow.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="flowout.jpg">
<p>
The following options are available:
<p>
<b><i>Strength</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this value is 255, mapped pixels are not blended
with the original pixel values, so a full-strength effect is obtained. As the value is
reduced, each mapped pixel is blended with more of the original pixel. At a value of 0,
the original pixels are passed through and there is no sharpening effect.
<p>
<b><i>Threshold</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This value determines how close a pixel must be to
the brightest or dimmest pixel to be mapped. If a pixel is more than threshold away from the
brightest or dimmest pixel, it is not mapped. Thus, as the threshold is reduced, pixels in
the mid range start to be spared.
<p>
Frankly, at this time it is not clear that <i>both</i> the strength and threshold parameters
are necessary. However, until matters become clear through experience, both are retained.
<p>
Feedback and suggestions will be gratefully received.
