<h4>Introduction</h4>
This plugin for VirtualDub implements an unusual concept
in spatial sharpening. Although designed specifically for anime,
it also works quite well on normal video. The filter is very effective
at sharpening important edges without amplifying noise.
<p>
This filter is not yet optimized for speed. Optimizations will be included
in a future version.
<p>
The justification for the filter is simple. The biggest complaint about
Unsharp Mask (for example) is that setting the strength high enough
to sharpen important edges also amplifyies noise and small detail.
MSharpen solves this problem effectively by detecting important edge areas
and then applying sharpening only to those areas.
You first set the 'threshold' parameter so that desired edges
are selected. Then you
set the sharpening strength. You can set very high sharpening strengths
without amplifying noise or fine detail
(because the edge map is used to mask the sharpening).
<p>
There is an important caveat about the use of this filter. It works best on
frames obtained from progressive source material, such as films and anime.
Although it can be used on deinterlaced video, if the deinterlacing is poor
or applied weakly, this filter can emphasize the residual combing, because it
sharpens the important edges; these edges are where the most combing occurs!
So be aware of this. All filters have their domains of application, and it would be
a mistake to think of any filter as a panacea.
<p><hr><h4>MSharpen Configuration Options</h4>
<p>
<b><i>Strength</i></b>: This is the strength of the sharpening
to be applied to the edge detail areas. It is applied
only to the edge detail areas as determined by the 'Threshold' option. Strength 255
is the strongest sharpening.
<p>
<b><i>Threshold</i></b>: This parameter determines what is
detected as edge detail and thus sharpened. To see what edge detail areas will be
sharpened, use the 'Show sharpened areas' option.
<p>
<b><i>Show sharpened areas</i></b>: When checked, the areas to be sharpened are
shown in white against a black background. Use this to set the level of
detail to be sharpened. This function also makes a basic edge detection filter.
