VirtualDub's internal resize filter has a very powerful and fast resampling
engine, but its user interface is primitive. For example, there is no way to
scale the picture by a percentage; you have to hand calculate and enter both
the new width and new height. The Smart Resize filter duplicates the internal
resize functionality while greatly enhancing the user interface. The basic idea
is that a size calculator is added to the filter's dialog box. When enabled, the
configuration calculated is exported back into the main filter
parameters, which work the same as the internal filter's parameters. Smart Resize
supports adjustment of the aspect ratio, several scaling and fitting
modes, and "snapping" to required pixel multiples for the output height
and/or width. Batch processing is supported so that if the processing parameters are
saved with the size calculator enabled, the filter will dynamically calculate the
main filter settings based on the parameters of the input clips encountered while
processing the batch files. They need not be
calculated manually in advance.
<p>
This help file will first describe the calculator "pipeline". You'll need to understand this to
properly use the filter. Then the configuration options will be described.
Finally some usage examples will be presented.
<h3>The Calculator Pipeline</h3>
If a clip is loaded into VirtualDub and the Smart Resize filter is added, the
<i>Input width</i> and <i>Input height</i> boxes in the <i>Size Calculator</i> will
show the dimensions of the frame arriving at the filter. These two values are
the input to a pipeline of calculations, as depicted below:
<p>
--> Aspect ratio adjust --> Fitting/scaling --> Snapping --> 
<p>
When the calculator is enabled by checking the <i>Enable</i> checkbox,
the output values from the pipeline are calculated and transferred to the
main filter configuration and the preview (if any) is refreshed. Any changes to
the calculator settings cause an automatic recalculation and update of the main
filter parameters. Let us now consider the three stages of the pipeline.
<p>
<b><i>Aspect ratio adjust</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This stage allows for conversion of the aspect ratio. For example, you might have a source clip from DV that has an aspect ratio of
10/9 (pixel width/pixel height)
and you want to convert it to a 1/1 aspect ratio for display on the PC
monitor. This stage works as follows. The source aspect ratio is SW/SH. The
desired aspect ratio is DW/DH. The <i>Input width</i> value is now scaled as
follows:
<p>
<i>Input width'</i> = <i>Input width</i> * (DW * SH) / (DH * SW)
<p>
The <i>Input height</i> is not changed. For example, in the DV case described
above the source aspect ratio is 10/9 and the desired aspect ratio is
1/1. The adjustment factor is thus 9/10 and these are the values loaded into
the <i>Aspect ratio adjust</i> edit boxes. 
(If you prefer to simply view these boxes as permitting a horizontal scaling,
and then use them that way, that is fine! But the formula above tells you
how to determine the desired scaling to convert between aspect ratios.)
<p>
<b><i>Fitting/Scaling</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This stage takes the values from the
previous stage and scales them according to the selected mode. For example, if
the <i>Percent</i> mode is selected and 50 entered, the width and height will both be
reduced to 50% of their incoming values. Refer to the description of the configuration options
for details on the available modes.
<p>
<b><i>Snapping</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Often we require that the output width and/or
height are exact multiples of some number of pixels. For example, many MPEG
encoders require the width to be a multiple of 4 pixels. The snapping controls
allow this to be done automatically. Note that if both the width and height are
snapped, it might occur that to satisfy this, either the aspect ratio must be
changed slightly, or the borders of the frame must be padded. The controls allow
for selecting the desired treatment in these cases.
Refer to the description of the configuration options for details on the available modes.
<h3>The Configuration Options</h3>
<b><i>Enable</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this checkbox is checked, the size calculator
is enabled. The main filter parameters are automatically calculated and their values updated,
but their controls are disabled. To use the filter in batch mode, save the processing settings
with <i>Enable</i> checked.
<p>
<b><i>Aspect ratio adjust</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the edit boxes, enter the scaling fraction
by which the width is to be scaled (the height is left as is).
For example, use 2/1 to double the width. Note that in order to avoid crashing VirtualDub or
Windows, the aspect ratio cannot be set higher than 10/1 or lower than 1/10. Sometimes you might want to enter a ratio using high numbers, such as 720/640. The constraint just mentioned would not permit this as the edit boxes can only be typed one at a time. However, the constraint is not enforced if the <i>Enable</i> box is not checked. When the <i>Enable</i> box is subsequently checked the constraint is
tested and if it is violated, the
aspect ratio is reset to 1/1. Thus, you can enter high numbers by first
unchecking the <i>Enable</i> box.
<p>
<b><i>Fit width</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this mode is selected, the picture will
be scaled (maintaining the aspect ratio) so that the width is made equal to the
specified value. 
<p>
<b><i>Fit height</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this mode is selected, the picture will
be scaled (maintaining the aspect ratio) so that the height is made equal to the
specified value.
<p>
<b><i>Fit width and height</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this mode is selected, the picture will
be scaled (maintaining the aspect ratio) so that the width and height both best fit into the
frame size defined by the values in the <i>Fit width</i> and <i>Fit height</i> edit boxes.  
<p>
<b><i>Fit width and height w/letterbox</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this mode is selected, the picture will
be scaled (maintaining the aspect ratio) so that the width and height both best fit into the
frame size defined by the values in the <i>Fit width</i> and <i>Fit height</i> edit boxes,
and either the width or height will be expanded and letterboxed so that the resulting frame
is exactly the size defined by the edit boxes. See the <b><i>Examples</i></b> section for
a typical application. Note that because the output frame size is directly defined by the
edit boxes, snapping is not necessary and the snapping controls are disabled in this
fitting mode.  
<p>
<b><i>Percent</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When this mode is selected, the picture will
be scaled (maintaining the aspect ratio) by the specified percentage value. Do not enter excessively large values that create giant bitmaps or you may crash VirtualDub or Windows. 
<p>
<b><i>No enlarge</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode applies to all modes except the <i>Percent</i> mode.
When this mode is selected in <i>Fit width</i> mode,
the picture will not be enlarged if its width is already equal to or
less than the specified fit width value. When this mode is selected in <i>Fit
height</i> mode, the picture will not be enlarged if its height is already equal to or
less than the specified fit height value.
When this mode is selected in <i>Fit width and
height</i> or <i>Fit width and height w/letterbox</i> modes,
the picture will not be enlarged if the width and height are already
equal to or less than the specified frame size. This option makes sense only in batch mode.
For example, you might be processing a directory full of clips and you want to ensure that
all the clips do not exceed a bounding box, but you don't want any that are already within
the bounding box to be enlarged.
<p>
<b><i>No reduce</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode applies to all modes except the <i>Percent</i> mode.
When this mode is selected in <i>Fit width</i> mode,
the picture will not be reduced if its width is already equal to or
greater than the specified fit width value. When this mode is selected in <i>Fit
height</i> mode, the picture will not be reduced if its height is already equal to or
greater than the specified fit height value.
When this mode is selected in <i>Fit width and
height</i> or <i>Fit width and height w/letterbox</i> modes,
the picture will not be enlarged if the width and height are already
equal to or greater than the specified frame size.
<p>
<b><i>Fix width to mult of</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode will cause the output
width to be snapped to a multiple of the specified number of pixels.
<p>
<b><i>Fix height to mult of</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode will cause the output
height to be snapped to a multiple of the specified number of pixels.
<p>
<b><i>Up/Down/Nearest</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This mode determines how to change the
dimension when a snap is done. Use <i>Up</i> to round up. Use <i>Down</i> to round down. Use
<i>Nearest</i> to round to the nearest multiple. Note that when both the width and the
height are snapped, and the padding mode is not set to <i>Adjust AR</i>, only the
rounding up mode is available (because the resize engine can only pad; it cannot
crop).
<p> 
<b><i>Pad width/Pad height/Adjust AR</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;These modes are active only
when both the width and the height are snapped. These modes determine what
to do if the two snaps cannot both be honored without padding or changing the
aspect ratio. Use the <i>Adjust AR</i> mode to allow the calculator to change
the aspect ratio in order to avoid padding. Use the <i>Pad width</i> mode to
allow the calculator to letterbox the picture by padding the two sides. Use the
<i>Pad height</i> mode to
allow the calculator to letterbox the picture by padding the top and bottom.
If padding is applied, it will be reflected in the <i>Frame width</i>
and <i>Frame
height</i> boxes in the main filter parameters.
<h3>Examples</h3>
<b><i>Example 1</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the user wants to try different
picture sizes while ensuring a width that is a multiple of 4. The clip is first loaded and
then the filter added. The preview can be enabled. Then the <i>Percent</i> mode
is selected and <i>Fit width to mult of</i> is selected and set to 4. The
desired percentage is entered.
<p>
<b><i>Example 2</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the user wants to convert a DV clip
at a 10/9 pixel aspect ratio for viewing on a PC's 1/1 monitor, and ensure an output width that
is a multiple of 16 pixels (to make encoder happy). The clip is loaded and the
filter added. The <i>Aspect ratio
adjust</i> is set to 9/10. The <i>Fix width to mult of</i> mode is selected and its
value set to 16.
<p>
<b><i>Example 3</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the user has a clip that is 512x398,
cropped from a 640x480 picture. The user wants to make a 480x480 Video CD. So he
must set the <i>Aspect ratio adjust</i> to 3/4 (because the Video CD requires a
1/1 aspect ratio). He sets the fit mode to <i>Fit width and height w/letterbox</i>,
and he sets the <i>Fit width</i> and <i>Fit height</i> values to 480. 
<h3>Thanks and Credits</h3>
The original internal resize filter from which Smart Resize was adapted was
created by Avery Lee, the author of VirtualDub. The performance and speed of his
resize engine is truly awesome. Gunnar Thalin implemented a stand-alone video
calculator. Jon C. Hodgson inspired me to create Smart Resize and assisted
during the development process.
