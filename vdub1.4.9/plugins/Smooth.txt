Smart Smoother Filter for Virtual Dub
(Version 1.1)

[Place this text file in the VirtualDub plugins directory to make

box. The computer must have a program called Notepad available in
its search path.]

This filter performs structure-preserving smoothing (blurring). It is ideal
for removing video noise as well as MPG/JPG blocking artifacts. The really
exceptional feature is that far from blurring image structure (edges, corners,
etc.), it actually sharpens them somewhat! I think you will agree that this
is a really awesome smoothing filter. Filter preview is supported.

A test is provided in the zip file, "arm.avi". It exhibits severe MPG blocking
artifacts. Try this: set the diameter to 11 and the strength to 50. Leave
interlaced unchecked. Look at the result. The text is actually sharpened a bit
and the blocking is totally gone. Image structure is almost perfectly retained. 

The following options are provided:

Diameter: This option determines the size of the area over which blurring is possible.
The bigger it is the slower the filter runs. Use large diameters for blocking artifacts
and smaller ones for graininess.

Strength: This option determines how much blurring is done. Use the lowest amount
that removes your noise/artifacts.

Interlaced source video: Check this if your source video is interlaced.

This filter requires an MMX-capable processor.

Thanks to Avery Lee and Gunnar Thalin for optimizing this filter for speed.
Thanks to Narendra Verma for suggesting that we needed a better smoother.
