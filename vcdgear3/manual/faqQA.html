      file?<br>
      <br>
      This depends on the following factors:<br>
      1) which option you pick<br>
      2) how big the source file is<br>
      3) how fast your system is (mainly hard drive and CPU dependent)<br>
      4) where the source file is located<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Depending on what options you pick, some may be faster than others.
      Turning on additional options such as Fix MPEG Errors will slow down the
      processing.&nbsp;Also, the larger the source file, the longer it will
      take. VCDGear depends heavily on how fast your system is -- but mainly the
      hard drive and CPU. A&nbsp;fast bus would be nice and perhaps even a SCSI
      or a high speed IDE. If the source file is located on a CDROM, expect the
      time to be much longer than if&nbsp;the file was on the hard drive.<br>
      <br>
      On average, it would take around 5-6 minutes to handle a full CD image on
      a Pentium II and a regular IDE hard drive.</font>

      <br>
      Perhaps, but not without rewriting important sections of the code and
      duplicating a lot of it as well. This would be difficult to manage the
      program when it comes to adding new features and/or making fixes. Most of
      the loss of speed is due to the checking code while the file is being
      processed. If all the checking code was removed, you most likely will not
      notice much improvement... and of course, VCDGear will not work properly

      SMP? (multiprocessor)<br>
      <br>
      If you run many CPU intensive programs in the background, VCDGear will
      run fine on SMP and it should not take up a large load. However, if you do
      not&nbsp;have SMP, VCDGear will take up a reasonable load. But having more
      than one processor will not double or triple the speed at which VCDGear
      runs.<br>
      <br>
      I suggest that you select the priority level (with GUI VCDGear 2.0) that
      you want VCDGear to run at. That way, you can balance how much processing
      power&nbsp;you want over speed (depending on how many tasks you are
      running in the background).</font>

      <br>
      On a VideoCD disc, there is physically no such thing as Track 0. Video
      tracks begin on Track 2 and the file directory info is on Track 1.
      However,&nbsp;when VCDGear reads in the CUE file, the first video track
      will been named Track 1. Thus, Track 0 is the file directory.<br>
      <br>
      Track 0 may also contain the CD-i MPEG bumper sequence in case you are
      interested in extracting it. WinOnCD/VideoPack will place the bumper
      in&nbsp;this area.</font>

      CD-i bumper? What does the Remove CD-i
      Bumper option (-nobumper)&nbsp;option do?<br>
      <br>
      A CD-i MPEG sequence is often applied by any VideoCD writing program.
      WinOnCD and VideoPack have this capability and possibly even Adaptec VCD&nbsp;Creator.
      A CD-i bumper is simply an MPEG sequence that is placed in the first track
      of a VideoCD. The reason being that a CD-i player will always&nbsp;play
      this MPEG sequence first.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, this MPEG bumper causes problems for software players. Some
      symptoms include player lockups, early ending time, slider freeze,
      top&nbsp;and/or bottom of video getting cut off by black bars, and a/v
      sync problems. All these problems are possibly related to the MPEG
      sequence having a&nbsp;different packet size. The packet size of the
      bumper most likely does not match that of a VideoCD. While the software
      player is able to play the&nbsp;bumper, as soon as the movie comes up, the
      packet size changes and this is probably the main reason why all the
      problems occur.<br>
      <br>
      VCDGear 2.0 now has a Remove CD-i Bumper option that is supposed to fix
      the problem. Users using the non-GUI version of VCDGear will find a
      similar&nbsp;option (-nobumper).</font>

      <br>
      First of all, a BIN is an image of a CD. The CUE file that accompanies
      a BIN tells where the tracks of the CD are located within the BIN image.
      As a&nbsp;result, you can have many tracks all stacked upon each other
      written in different modes -- and you can still recreate the original CD
      as long as the&nbsp;CUE file exists.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      A RAW file is also an image file, not as an entire CD, but rather just a
      single track.<br>
      <br>
      NOTE: VideoPack generates CD images with a .RAW extension -- this is a
      track image. VCDGear will be able to extract your MPEGs from these
      files&nbsp;using the RAW track image to MPEG (-raw2xxx).&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      You might run into problems with this option if the RAW track image
      includes a CD-i bumper sequence generated by WinOnCD/VideoPack. With
      VCDGear 2.0 and 1.5, there is an option to remove the CD-i bumper and
      theoretically should be able to handle the problem.<br>
      <br>
      People who have used BinChunker should recognize RAW track images as a
      .TAO or .MM2 file. This is exactly the same thing. A RAW track image does
      not&nbsp;contain multiple tracks so a CUE file is not necessary.</font>

      <br>
      A DAT file is basically an MPEG file with the exception that it is
      bigger - but for a good reason. A DAT file contains extra information
      inside such as&nbsp;error correction information and extra sector
      information, but it also contains the MPEG stream. The MPEG file, of
      course, does not contain all&nbsp;the extra data that a DAT contains and
      is smaller.</font>

      <br>
        You should use this when you have a VideoCD track image that does not
        have its own CUE file.<br>
      <br>
        NOTE: this should be a LAST RESORT option because it may not work for
        ALL VideoCDs (most have worked for me, others have not).<br>
      <br>
        This option can also be used for a BIN/CUE file. If you are missing the
        CUE index file, try to get the CUE file before attempting the
        RAW-to-MPEG/DAT&nbsp;option. The CUE file is more accurate at
        pin-pointing where the MPEG data is located.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If the image has multiple
        tracks, version 1.6 console and 2.5 GUI should automatically cut up to
        the end of the video track.&nbsp; If you specify the -nocut option, the
        video tracks will not be cut, and will instead be joined together.

      The -fix option makes sure that your output MPEG file won't have broken

      MPEG&nbsp;blocks but I don't know how this will affect the sync timings. I
      have been told that this option fixes the &quot;slider problem&quot; in
      the Microsoft Media&nbsp;Player. This may also fix up some areas where
      screen artifacts, or a sudden display of coloured blocks appear on the

        This option is used only if you have a track image that does not
        include a CUE file and it has a non-standard sector size.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
        Example: If your track image was written with 2336-bytes/sector, you

        vcdgear -raw2xxx -r2336 inputfile outputfile<br>

      on what this option does and when to properly use it).<br>
      <br>
      With VCDGear 1.5+ (non-GUI), use the following command at the DOS prompt:<br>
      <br>
      vcdgear -xxx2mpg -fix inputFile outputFile<br>
      <br>
      where the 'xxx' represents the first three characters for the type of

      completion, the number of errors will be reported.<br>
      <br>
      NOTE: This will NOT fix corrupt data in your MPEG stream. (Usually causes
      the playback software to lock-up or crash). Please use a separate program
      such as IFilmEdit or M1-Edit MPEG Repair to remove the areas with

      <br>
        The better solution is to use the RAW-to-MPG option instead. It uses a
        smart search to locate the MPEG header rather than guessing. Also, you
        might want to turn on the Fix MPEG Errors (-fix) option.

 The most likely problem here is because there might be a CD-i bumper

 First of all, this question does not mean &quot;widescreen&quot;, nor &quot;NTSC
        to PAL conversion&quot;.
        Again, the most likely cause of this is that there is a CD-i bumper in

      <br>
 First of all, I am assuming that the movie has been encoded properly
        and it is not the person who encoded the video that cut the ends too
        quickly (e.g.&nbsp;to skip the credits because there wasn't enough
        space).<br>
      <br>
        There have been a few reports about this problem in the past but
        unfortunately, I have been unable to trace this problem since it has
        never happened to me. It has not come up as an issue lately.&nbsp;</font>
      <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="3">What I&nbsp;can recommend is
        try all the options. Try extracting the movie with the Fix MPEG Errors
        (-fix) options turned on, and also try extracting it without
        the&nbsp;fix options. Then compare the output... are they both still
        missing the beginning/end? Also you might want to try comparing the
        output of a DAT and&nbsp;the output of an MPG.
