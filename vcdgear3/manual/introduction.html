<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">VCDGear is a tool to extract MPEG
streams from CD images, do conversions of one video format to <br>
another, create VideoCD images, and more!<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">VCDGear was developed in the late
1997 as a personal project.&nbsp; At that time, I had a 2x burner which <br>
was not capable of writing VCD images in DAO.&nbsp; What began as a few lines of
code in QuickBasic (yes, <br>
QB... not VB!) led to the development of ISO2VCD v0.1 which was written in
C.&nbsp; Suggestions from other <br>
people to add additional features and improve performance started to pour
in.&nbsp; The name ISO2VCD<br>
was dropped, and thus VCDGear v1.1 was born (actually, it was called VCD.Gear).&nbsp;

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">It had three (!!) incredible options
:)&nbsp; Future releases improved upon performance and added a whole slew<br>
of features.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="3">Currently VCDGear is
supported on a number of platforms.&nbsp; </font></p>
