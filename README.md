These are some ancient (circa 2001ish) VCD/DVD/DivX/XviD tools.

Once upon a time, I captured and encoded my own TV shows. This led
me to meet a group called TMD MovieZ and at one point I was an OP
in their IRC channel. Alas, Venomous and StirCrazy fucked each other
(literally) and vio got mad about it. Wooly went off to start something
else caled KWD MovieZ and Doll (the D in KWD) was a bit of a flirt and 
played both sides of that fence. 

All in all, an epic joke and a wasted few years and drama in the IRC-verse. 
That said, those TMD fuckers did squish movies down small enough to DCC 
effectively even over 56K dialup of the time. How did they do it? Simple, 
they cut the frame-rate to 15fps, set the audio at 96KHz MP3, and squished
the holy shit out of the movies. They looked fine on a 320x240 NTSC TV
though, didn't they? Ahh, who cares. The "secret sauce" TMD .vcf file for 
making some of your own TMD MovieZ in TMPGEnc. Multiple versions of the
originally free TMPENC are here as well as lots of other ancient codecs
and goodies.

I CLAIM NO RESPONSIBLITY FOR ANY OF THESE FILES, I just don't want them lost
to the digital-dustbin so I'm enshrining them forever in the cloud.
