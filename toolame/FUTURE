Feel free to contribute code for any of the following 
(they're listed in some sort of priority)
	- updated VBR mode. (improved VBR_a_bit_allocation)
	- fix LSF mode.  LSF will segfault for unknown reasons unless you use the 
		-f option. I think there's an infinite loop condition in there 
		somewhere, but I haven't gone looking for it yet.
	- reading from stdin could be made less kludgy I suppose.
	- psy-model speed ups
	- a_bit_allocation optimization
	- remove need for atan2 calls in fft.c
	- plenty of other functions could be merged.
